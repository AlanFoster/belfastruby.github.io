Belfast Ruby isn't just for experienced Ruby developers, our meetups are for anyone with an interest in learning a little bit about Ruby or Rails. Our event will precede the Dribbble meetup, starting at 7pm at 21 Social, giving [Break](http://breakconf.org/) attendees a chance to grab a bite to eat following the previous event. If you haven't scooped up a ticket for Break, don't worry, our meetup is open to everyone.

We're currently on the lookout for people willing to give a short Ruby-related talk at the meetup. If you're interested get in touch via [email](mailto:mkeizer@rumblelabs.com) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/belfastruby). We hope to see plenty of new faces and look forward to enjoying the Break Conf buzz.
