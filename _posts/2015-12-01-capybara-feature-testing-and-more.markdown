intro: "Time to update your diaries, as the December 2015 meetup has now been confirmed! We have three great talks lined up, suited to both the aspiring and experienced Rubyists among us."

---

Your unit tests may be working, but did you actually deliver that feature you promised? Let's take a step back, and test your web application as a whole - as the user would. Our first talk is presented by [Alan Foster](https://www.github.com/alanfoster) who will discuss automated Capybara Feature Testing in Ruby.

Following Alan, [Andrew Carr](https://twitter.com/ac2u) will be giving a talk on alternative Rails architectures.

The third and final talk will be given by Lead [ShopKeep](http://www.shopkeep.com/) Engineer [Paul Guelpa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulguelpa). Paul will be specially visiting from the New York offices to impart his wisdom on how implementing ShopKeep's platform services in Go has taught him more about Ruby.

With the next meetup being so close to the festivity of Christmas, let's start the celebrations with mulled wine and food.

Be sure to watch this space for any updates!
