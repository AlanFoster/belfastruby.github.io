We have lined up a meetup (venue to be decided) on Tuesday the 28th of March 2017. We have three great talks lined up.

**Pete Hawkins**

[Pete](https://twitter.com/peteyhawkins) of [Dawson & Andrews](https://dawsonandrews.com/) will give a talk on rails 5 + webpack and how to enrich your project with a suite of rich client side features.

**David Schmitt**

[David](https://puppet.com/blog/author/david-schmitt) of Puppet Labs will give an introductory talk on RSpec the behaviour driven development framework.

**Stephen McCullough**

[Stephen](http://twitter.com/swmcc) of [ShopKeep](http://www.shopkeep.com/) will build a bot for Slack. The time allotted is 30mins. The aim for this talk is:

• test driven

• have a bot talking in the belfastruby slack room

• pushed onto github so attendees can offer PRs in the form of bugfixes or enhancements later

Hope to see you there,
Stephen
