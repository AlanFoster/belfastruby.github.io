Much like our previous [Lean Coffee](http://www.mkdown.com/59e0246aa46f8e159a98) meetup, we're holding a structured but agenda-less meeting where we'll spend the evening discussing development-related topics. You can post your topic suggestions to our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/mGGJmO7b/belfast-ruby-discussion-topics) prior to the meetup.

On the night we'll pick out the discussion topics that interest everyone. So come along to The Hudson on Tuesday and share your thoughts over a few casual drinks. We hope to see you there!
