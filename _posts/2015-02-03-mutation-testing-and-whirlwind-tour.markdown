intro: "February will be host to our first meetup of 2015 and we can't wait to catch up with everyone and hopefully welcome a few new faces. We've got two great talks lined up, suited to both the aspiring and experienced Rubyists among us. So keep your Tuesday evening free and pop over to Shopkeep's office for some inspiration and practical tips."

We all know that we should test our code. It gives us confidence and
prevents bugs creeping in. During the evening you'll learn how to take testing one step further by testing your tests, as [Dean Barnett](https://twitter.com/deanobarn) discusses mutation testing.

Following Dean, fellow [ShopKeep](http://www.shopkeep.com/) developer [Stephen Rushe](https://twitter.com/srushe) will take us on a tour of Ruby projects, exploring how Ruby exists beyond Rails by looking at some interesting projects.

If that isn't enough, there'll be drinks and free pizza kindly supplied by [FourStarPizza](http://www.fourstarpizza.co.uk/). We hope to see you there!
